## Platformer - Part 3

Ship it! Shigeru Miyamoto is confident after you success with breakout that you understand how to test and deploy software. He thinks the special mechnaic you have implmented might even top that of Mario! However, what makes Shigeru Miyamoto a great developer is his discipline. With that--he would like you to perform a postmortem for part 3 of this journey and do a a little bit of marketing. 


## Step 1 - Documentation
Fire up 'Doxygen' <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">(Doxygen webpage)</a> to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

## Step 2 - Build (binary file)
You need to have a compiled binary of your game. You can assume a target audience of either a 64-bit Mac, Ubuntu Linux, or Windows 10 machine. There should additionally be instructions about how to compile your code from source.

## Step 3 - Post mortem
A post mortem in games is a look back at what could be improved. Write a brief (2-3 paragraphs) on what could be improved if you had an additional 8 weeks to work on this project. Where would you allocate time, what tools would you build, would you use any different tools, etc.

## Step 4 - Website
Your documentation, a link to your binary, and your post mortem should be put together on a 1-page .html page. Additionally, provide a 1 minute video trailer(but 1 minute I suggest) and at least 3 screenshots of your game. This website will be the first place I look to grab your project. (Additionally, I think it is important to build a portfolio of your game development works!)

## Part 3 - Game Requirements (Summary)
### Part 3 - Rubric (5% of overall grade)

* (25%) Documentation - Did you generate something like "https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html"
* (25%) Build - Does the build work when I download your repo and run the game.
* (25%) Post mortem - Did you learn anything?
* (25%) Website - Do you have a webpage that presents your project in a positive way with the above materials.

## Part 2 - Game Requirements (Summary)

### Part 2 - Rubric (5% of overall grade)

* (50%) Special Feature (X-Factor).
  * A brief description of the feature and implementation should be documented in part 3.
* (50%) Are there enemies? 
  * (And do they collide and interact properly with the world. Can a player reliably eliminate them, or if not eliminate them, dose the player collide with enemies and lose the game appropriately?)

## Part 1 - Game Requirements (Summary)

The breakout game you are building in part 1 has the following requirements.
* (50%) The Game requirements should be met below.
* (50%) The game and editors should feel polished and work.

#### Game Requirements

The platform game you are building in part 1 has the following requirements.

- There should be 1 music track that plays in the background
- You should have an animated sprite for the main character.
- Your character should be able to run and jump (arrowkeys and spacebar or WASD and spacebar)
- There should be tiles that a character can run on and jump over
  - That means you should think about a 2D collision system
- There should have some 'background' image (i.e. clouds in the sky, mountains, a blue gradient, etc) in your world.
- You should think about 'enemy characters' (This will be implemented in part 2)
- You should think about a 'special feature' or gameplay mechanic that makes your game unique.
- There should be a tile editor (see next section)
- You should include a sprite editor (see next section)
