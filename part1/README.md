# Part 1

## The Business

The gaming business is a volatile business. It is volatile because it changes and moves forward, innovates, and then the cycle repeats. The good news is that your team has made millions from the success of breakout. You have successfully completed your contract with your old boss, but now it is time to move on.

This time however, you have caught the attention of another game designer: Shigeru Miyamoto

## Shigeru Miyamoto

Shigeru Miyamoto is the legendary game designer of Mario and several other Nintendo franchises.

## Platformer Games

For this series of assignments, we are going to build a 2D platformer game.


Step 1 - Play the game!
If you are unfamaliar with Mario or platformer games, you can play a version here:

*TBD*

Step 2 - Form a team!

Make sure you form a team! (If you are reading this, make sure your teammates join your same repository)

## Our technology stack

Nolan has decided that you will be using the following technology stack:

* Modern C++ (11/14/17)
* SDL library

Nolan prefers these tools because SDL is an industry standard, cross platform, and using C++ will give us some additional speed. 

Right now, Nolan wants us to produce the game quickly however, as demand is high for this title!

## Project Hieararchy

In the future, other engineers may take on our project, so we'll have to keep it organized given the following requirements below.
Forming some good habits now will help us later on when our project grows.

Game

- Docs -- Source Code Documentation
- Assets -- Art assets (With the Sub directories music, sound, images, and anything else)
- src -- source code(.cpp files) The make file or any build scripts that automate the building of your project should reside here.
- include -- header files(.h files)
- lib -- libraries (.so, .dll, .a, .dylib files). Note this is a good place to put SDL
- temp -- This is the directory where your built executable(.exe for windows, .app for Mac, or a.out for Linux) and any additional generated files are put after each build.
- Game -- Your final deliverable. One should be able to copy and paste this directory, and only this directory onto another machine and be able to run the game.
- ThirdParty - Code that you have not written if any.

Note that src should only contain ".cpp" or ".h" files. Why? It makes it very fast to do a backup of your src directory as one example. Secondly, binary files that are generated often clutter up directories. I should not see any binaries in your repository. 

## Game Requirements

The platform game you are building in part 1 has the following requirements.

### Level Editor
- tbd

### Game

Beyond those requirements, you may get as creative as you like.

Tips:
* 

## Rubric (5% of overall grade)

* (50%) The Game requirements should be met above.
* (50%) The game should feel polished
